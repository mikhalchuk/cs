### Main points:
In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:
* push, which adds an element to the collection, and
* pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack.

A stack can be easily implemented either through an array or a linked list.

* Search: O(n)
* Insertion: O(1)
* Deletion: O(1)
